\noindent History is the most pleasing theatre imaginable; for there a man learns for himself at the expense of others, there he can see shipwrecks without fear, war without danger, the customs and institutions of many nations without expense. There he descries the origins, means and ends and the causes of the growth and downfall of empires, there he learns why some princes reign in tranquillity and others are burdened with many troubles, some flourish through the arts of peace, and others by valour in war, some spending lavishly without profit, others sparingly and with dignity.
