	Abstract = {Among the most popular books in Renaissance England, treatises on heraldry are of more than technical interest. Along with discussing the correct description of coats of arms, works such as Ferne's Blazon of Gentrie, Bossewell's Workes of Armorie, Legh's Accedens of Armorie, or Guillim's A Display of Heraldrie shared the theoretical concerns of the courtesy books and treatises of nobility. Packed full of arcane information and remarkable ``historical'' accounts, these works are not only important sources for the study of Renaissance thought, especially on social order and the nature of nobility, but they are also important sources for the study of English literature as well as being remarkable literary works in their own right.},

Contrary to a long-standing consensus, Shakespeare does not seem to have been opposed, nor indifferent, to the publication of his plays, but pursued a policy of trying to get them published. Accordingly, Shakespeare's long playtexts survive in a literary format and would have been considerably abridged before reaching the stage.},

@article{hindle_imagining_2008,
	Abstract = {This essay reconstructs the discourses concerning hunger, protest, punishment and paternalism that circulated during and after the Midland Rising, a series of anti-enclosure protests which spread across the counties of Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Warwickshire in the late spring and early summer of 1607. Through a reconstruction of the views of the rebel leader John Reynolds, of the monarch King James I, of the clergyman Robert Wilkinson and of the crown-lawyer Francis Bacon, it is suggested that, although though they disagreed about whether hunger might ever justify insurrection, those implicated in the Rising and its suppression shared a stock of common idioms -- the scriptural critique of enclosure derived from the Book of Isaiah, the classical metaphor of the body politic, the hunger-pangs of the empty belly -- with which to discuss the social problems of the day. These idioms, it is argued, were also deployed by a fifth observer of the Midland Rising, who in Act one Scene one of Coriolanus (first performed in 1608) represented a company of mutinous citizens standing up about the corn. Coriolanus is arguably Shakespeare's attempt to imagine insurrection by dramatizing it, and therefore constitutes a fertile source for the historian of early modern popular protest.},

@book{chernaik_myth_2011,
	Abstract = {When Cleopatra expresses a desire to die 'after the high Roman fashion', acting in accordance with 'what's brave, what's noble', Shakespeare is suggesting that there are certain values that are characteristically Roman. The use of the terms {'Rome'} and {'Roman'} in Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, or Jonson's Sejanus often carry the implication that most people fail to live up to this ideal of conduct, that very few Romans are worthy of the name. Chernaik demonstrates how, in these plays, Roman values are held up to critical scrutiny. The plays of Shakespeare, Jonson, Massinger and Chapman often present a much darker image of Rome, as exemplifying barbarism rather than civility. Through a comparative analysis of the Roman plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and including detailed discussion of the classical historians Livy, Tacitus and Plutarch, this study examines the uses of Roman history - 'the myth of Rome' - in Shakespeare's age.},

The author shows that Shakespeare was strikingly averse to such absolutes and constantly probed the possibility of freedom from them. Again and again, Shakespeare confounds the designs and pretensions of kings, generals, and churchmen. His aversion to absolutes even leads him to probe the exalted and seemingly limitless passions of his lovers. The author explores this rich theme by addressing four of Shakespeare's preoccupations across all the genres in which he worked.},
